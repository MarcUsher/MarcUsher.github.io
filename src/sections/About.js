          <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
          <p>Iâ€™m a multilingual Software Engineer with professional software engineering experience and over 8 years experience in Digital Marketing at internationally-renowned HE institutions.</p>

          <p>Most recently, I developed public transport data analytics products at <b><a href="https://www.itoworld.com/">Ito World</a></b> for the Department for Transport and major transport clients as part of a full-stack engineering team, with a focus on Django and Ariadne (GraphQL) API back-end architecture connecting with PostgreSQL databases in Dockerized microservice-structured products.</p>

          <p>I completed General Assembly's full-time immersive <a href='https://generalassemb.ly/education/software-engineering-immersive/london'>Software Engineering course</a> where I led and worked in small teams to collaboratively build full-stack applications from the ground up. I interpreted project requirements from the original brief, planned out data structures and application architecture, and created and deployed full-stack applications in the MERN stack and in Django with a PostgreSQL database.</p>

          <p>I bring a positive impact to internal teams and practices with my collaboration skills and attention to detail, while my strong stakeholder and project management skills enable successful internal and external relationships.</p>
