          <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
          <p>My passion for digital innovation led me to work as a Digital Marketer at internationally-renowned institutions for over eight years, where I successfully led and delivered large-scale projects.</p>

          <p>Most notably, I’m proud to have project managed a complete institutional website redesign and relaunch, which deepened my interest in software engineering and led me to study full time with General Assembly. </p>

          <p>I bring a positive impact to internal teams and practices with my collaboration skills and attention to detail, while my strong stakeholder and project management skills enable successful external client relationships.</p>

          <p>I’m excited to bring my experience to a new career as a Software Engineer, working in a collaborative team and learning from others to create innovative and well-designed applications.</p>
